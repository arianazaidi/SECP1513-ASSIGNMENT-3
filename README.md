🏛️ Industry Insight: Serunai Industry Talk
Focus: Balancing Creative Multimedia with Structured Engineering

Speaker: Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim, Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd

I joined this session to explore how Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and project management frameworks provide the necessary structure for creative technical projects.

🚀 Technical Highlights:
Agile Methodology: Why iterative cycles are essential for multimedia development, allowing for rapid feedback and asset refinement.

SDLC Discipline: Understanding the rigorous path from initial requirements gathering to final deployment.

Risk Management: Implementing "safety nets" to ensure high-stakes system reliability.

Key takeaway: Technical creativity is most effective when supported by a disciplined framework. I am integrating these Agile principles into my workflow to build more robust and user-centric multimedia solutions.
